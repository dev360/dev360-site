My [avatar](http://samspratt.tumblr.com/post/17974870393/sam-spratt-paint-all-the-memes) was made by Sam Spratt - I just found it somewhere on the internet.

The particle animation was hacked together from the Sketch.js [Particles tutorial](http://soulwire.github.io/sketch.js/examples/particles.html)

The css animations are mostly courtesy of [csshake](http://elrumordelaluz.github.io/csshake/).
